COMPILING THE CODE:
- For instance in c++, the command allows for a c++ program for exmple goodbye.cpp

- The command that translates the source code into an object file, which also links a library to allow for executable code.

IDE: 

- Using an IDE: If youâ€™re using an IDE, it often has built-in tools to compile and run your programs. You typically write your code, then click a button to compile, and another to run the program.
